# 2. numbers - i.e id number  - int/floats
# 3. lists  - i.e lists of towns
# 4. tuples - i.e tuple of teams
# 5. Dictionary - stores an object
# 6. Sets - i.e 9F + 7

# variables store data
# var   value

# variables are like containers of values
# variables is up to the developer to come up with the name
# Use meaningful names for your variable
# DO NOT USE SPACES, use underscore instead.
# DO NOT SYMBOLS
# Variable names are CASE SENSITIVE . i.e name and Name are different
